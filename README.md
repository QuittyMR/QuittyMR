#### I solve technical issues. 

On good days, i also prevent them from happening in the first place.

I do Python, Scala, Go, JS when i have to, Java when i really have to and C if you let me.<br/>
Currently slightly infatuated with Groovy, but it will blow over.

Nowadays, most of my work is done via [my Gitlab account](https://gitlab.com/thomas478)
